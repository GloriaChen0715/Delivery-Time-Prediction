# Delivery-Time-Prediction

It is very important for food delivery company to get this right, as it has a big impact on consumer experience. Order lateness / underprediction of delivery time is of particular concern as past experiments suggest that underestimating delivery time is roughly twice as costly as overestimating it. Orders that are very early / late are also much worse than those that are only slightly early / late. In this project, I will build a model to predict the estimated time taken for a delivery.
